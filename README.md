This repository demonstrates a common but often overlooked error in Python: incomplete exception handling. The `bug.py` file contains a function that handles `ZeroDivisionError` and `TypeError` exceptions but neglects other possibilities, resulting in unpredictable behavior if the function receives unexpected input.  The `bugSolution.py` file provides a more robust solution by using a broader `except` block or explicitly handling other potential exceptions. This showcases the importance of exhaustive error checking and the consideration of various potential failure modes in production code.
